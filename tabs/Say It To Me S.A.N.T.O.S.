Say It To Me S.A.N.T.O.S.
Key of: Am 

Verse: Am (Trey & Page)
My thoughts are frozen
Like everyone else
You will always be remembered
Even life itself

Pre-Chorus: Am
Say it to me S.A.N.T.O.S. (ALL)
And try to make it rhyme (just Trey & Page)
Say it to me S.A.N.T.O.S. (ALL)
In normal moving time
Say it to me S.A.N.T.O.S. (ALL)
Itâ€™s off to work we go
D             
Say it to me S.A.N.T.O.S. (ALL)
G
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho, heigh-ho! (ALL)

Chorus 2x:
Am                 C

You will always remember where you were

BRIDGE:
       Am           C
We are lost, We are vapor (or winter)
       G              D
We are liquid, We are light
         Am            C
WE ARE divided, We are liquid
       G             D
We are vapor, We are light
