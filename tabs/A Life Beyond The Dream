A Life Beyond The Dream

INTRO: D, Dsus4

             G Gsus4 G                  D  Dsus4  D
When we were talking,  I didn't need to hide
                A  Asus4 A                      D  Dsus4  D
Black stallions through the night, on a perfect ride
              G Gsus4 G                   D  Dsus4  D
I watched you open wide,  you looked into me
               A   Asus4  A
I had to turn away
               G      D/F#m  F  E (hold 3x)
I didn't wanna leave

CHORUS:
E                           B
Now I'm letting it all roll by
A                                 E
I can see, I can see, A life beyond the dream
E                        B
I'm watching it all roll by
A                                 E
I can see, I can see, A life beyond the dream

BRIDGE:
G                   D
Don't give up hope, Don't give up hope
A              E7
Keep dreaming, Keep on dreaming
G                   D                    A       
Don't give up hope, Don't give up hope

Intro: D  Dsus4  D

               G Gsus4 G               D  Dsus4  D
We share these moments, till they melt away
          A  Asus4 A             D  Dsus4  D 
Two foggy memories, of a distant day
             G Gsus4 G             D  Dsus4  D
A curtain is blowing,   in an open door
              A             Asus4  A
Two souls can breath as one
         G      D/F#m  F  E (hold it)
I wanted more
