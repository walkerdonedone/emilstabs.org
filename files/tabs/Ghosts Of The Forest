Get in, get out

I know you know that you are me
And I am you, and we are here
And you're the one to take me down
So take me down, take me down
I know you know that you are me
And I am you, and we are here
And you're the one to take me down
So take me down, take me down
 
Walk slowly, step and you can listen while you
So quiet I can almost hear my pulse in my hands
Walk slowly, step and you can listen while you
So quiet I can almost hear my pulse in my hands
 
I know you know that you are me
And I am you, and we are here
And you're the one to take me down
So take me down, take me down
My lips, the cool air pushes me down in the mush
I turn my head
You know why, but you are me
And I am you, and we are here
You caught my eye
And if it's now, then let it all be you
 
Ghost of the forest (4x)
